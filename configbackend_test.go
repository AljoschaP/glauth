// Functions to test easily
//  * getGroupMembers
//  * getGroupMemberIDs
//  * getGroupDNs
//  * getGroupName

// Functions which are more difficult to test
//  * Bind
//  * Close - not even sure?
//  * Search - will have to probably look into mocking


// TODO before testing:
//  Perhaps take a look at splitting up bind() and search()
